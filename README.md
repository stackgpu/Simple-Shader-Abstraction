# Simple-Shader-Abstraction

mikola please rename to whatever you want (maybe simple-shader-graph? idk up to you)


simple shader abstraction creates webGPU Shaders for framework agnostic us

feature Request: 
pls design declaratively so AI can write shader abstraction using JSON in 5 years (if you think thats a good idea, i think it makes it easier for users too :)
